## Completion for Fast Downward

We support tab completion for bash and zsh based on the python package [argcomplete](https://pypi.org/project/argcomplete/) which can be installed via apt

```bash
sudo apt install python3-argcomplete
```

or pip

```bash
pip install argcomplete
```

We recommand to globally enable tab completion for argcomplete as follows. This will enable argcomplete for all python programs which use argcomplete. You can find local alternatives in the [argcomplete documentation](https://pypi.org/project/argcomplete/#activating-global-completion).

```bash
activate-global-python-argcomplete
```

Restart your shell afterwards.

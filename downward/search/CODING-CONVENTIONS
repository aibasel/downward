This is not meant to be a complete description of coding conventions.
General advice: follow the example of the existing code.

We mostly follow the style known as "K&R" or "stroupstrup" (see
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style), with a few exceptions. For
example, unlike K&R, we don't special-case the use of braces around
function definitions.


Here's some basic rules:

 * Indentation: Indent with spaces, not tabs. Use four spaces per
   level of indentation.

 * Whitespace usage: New code should use a single space after control
   structures that use parentheses ("for", "while", "if"), as in:
   "if (x)" rather than "if(x)".

 * Placement of braces: We use the following style:

   if (foo) {
       bar();
   } else if (foobar) {
       baz();
   } else if (quux) {
       quuux();
   } else {
       quuuux();
   }

   Braces can be omitted for control structures with only a single
   statement, but don't mix using braces with no braces within the
   same if/else block. For example, this is not OK:

   if (foo) {
       bar();
       baz();
   } else
       foobar();
 
   (In that case, also use braces for the else block.)

 * header file guards: take the filename (if in a subdirectory,
   including the subdirectory name), convert to uppercase, and replace
   "." and "/" with "_". For example, "learning/state_space_sample.h"
   becomes "LEARNING_STATE_SPACE_SAMPLE_H". Then use the following
   guard block in the header file:

   #ifndef LEARNING_STATE_SPACE_SAMPLE_H
   #define LEARNING_STATE_SPACE_SAMPLE_H
   // ...
   #endif

   That's all. For example, don't add a comment after the #endif, and
   don't add further underscores at the start or end of the guard
   name.

 * namespaces: Every subdirectory should correspond to a namespace.
   (As of r3821, this has not yet been done.) Namespaces follow the
   same camel-case naming convention as classes. For example, we would
   expect file my_subdir/my_class.h to contain a definition of class
   MySubdir::MyClass. (Actually, namespaces should rather have short,
   single-word names if possibe; this example only uses an underscore
   in the subdir name for sake of illustration.)

This directory archives Fast Downward experiments. All experiments
use their own common_setup.py module that simplifies the creation of
experiments. We recommend using common_setup.py from issue392 for
new experiments since it is the most polished version and provides
the greatest flexibility.

Below we list some experiments that show how certain tasks can be
performed:

* Test changes that affect the whole planner:
  * issue422/issue422.py shows the general setup but tests only LM-cut.
    Use "from downward.configs import default_configs_optimal" and set
    the parameter suite to default_configs_optimal. For satisficing
    configs use default_configs_satisficing and
    suite_satisficing_with_ipc11.

* Add a custom log parser:
  * issue469/issue469.py adds a parser for raw_memory

* Add scatter plots for custom attributes:
  * issue214/issue214.py

* Run configurations on the same tasks multiple times to reduce noise:
  * issue420/issue420-v1-regressions.py

* Independent CompareRevisionReports for portfolio configs and core solvers:
  * issue462/issue462-opt.py

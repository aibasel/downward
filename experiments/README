This directory archives Fast Downward experiments. All experiments
use their own common_setup.py module that simplifies the creation of
experiments. We recommend using common_setup.py from issue422 for
new experiments since it is the most polished version and provides
the greatest flexibility.

Below we list some experiments that show how certain tasks can be
performed:

* issue214/issue214.py:
  * Add a custom log parser (alternatively use exp.add_search_parser()).
  * Add scatter plots for custom attributes.

* issue420/issue420-v1-regressions.py:
  * Run configurations on the same tasks multiple times to reduce noise.

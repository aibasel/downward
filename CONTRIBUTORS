History
=======

The current version of Fast Downward is the merger of three different
projects:

 * the original version of Fast Downward developed by Malte Helmert and
   Silvia Richter
 * LAMA, developed by Silvia Richter and Matthias Westphal based on the
   original Fast Downward
 * FD-Tech, a modified version of Fast Downward developed by Erez
   Karpas and Michael Katz based on the original code

In addition to these three main sources, the codebase incorporates code
and features from numerous branches of the Fast Downward codebase
developed for various research papers. The main contributors to these
branches are Malte Helmert, Gabi Röger and Silvia Richter.

## History

The current version of Fast Downward is the merger of three different
projects:

- the original version of Fast Downward developed by Malte Helmert
  and Silvia Richter
- LAMA, developed by Silvia Richter and Matthias Westphal based on
  the original Fast Downward
- FD-Tech, a modified version of Fast Downward developed by Erez
  Karpas and Michael Katz based on the original code

In addition to these three main sources, the codebase incorporates
code and features from numerous branches of the Fast Downward codebase
developed for various research papers. The main contributors to these
branches are Malte Helmert, Gabi Röger and Silvia Richter.

"""This module contains a function for simplifying tasks in
finite-domain representation (SASTask). Usage:

    simplify.filter_unreachable_propositions(sas_task)

simplifies `sas_task` in-place. If simplification detects that the
task is unsolvable, the function raises `simplify.Impossible`.

The simplification procedure generates DTGs for the task and then
removes facts that are unreachable from the initial state in a DTG.
Note that such unreachable facts can exist even though we perform a
relaxed reachability analysis before grounding (and DTG reachability
is weaker than relaxed reachability) because the previous relaxed
reachability does not take into account any mutex information, while
PDDL-to-SAS conversion gets rid of certain operators that cannot be
applicable given the mutex information.

Despite the name, the method touches more than the set of facts. For
example, operators that have preconditions on pruned facts are
removed, too. (See also the docstring of
filter_unreachable_propositions.)

      because instantiate.py only reasons at the predicate level, and some
      predicates such as "at" in Depot are constant for some objects
      (hoists), but not others (trucks).

      Example: "at(hoist1, distributor0)" and the associated variable
      in depots-01.

    - "none of those" values that are unreachable.

      Example: at(truck1, ?x) = <none of those> in depots-01.

    - Certain values that are relaxed reachable but detected as
      unreachable after SAS instantiation because the only operators
      that set them have inconsistent preconditions.

      Example: on(crate0, crate0) in depots-01.

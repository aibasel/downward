  Derive from this class to add new operator-counting constraints. We support
  two types of constraints:
    - *Permanent constraints* are created once for the planning task and then
      reused for all states that are evaluated. It is possible (and usually
      necessary) to update the bounds of the constraint for every given state,
      but not the coefficients.
      Example: flow constraints such as
        move_ab + move_ac - move_ba - move_ca <= X,
      where X depends on the value of "at_a" in the current state and goal.
    - *Temporary constraints* are added for a given state and then removed.
      Example: constraints from landmarks generated for a given state, e.g.
      using the LM-Cut method.

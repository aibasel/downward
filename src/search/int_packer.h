/*
  Utility class to pack lots of unsigned integers (called "variables"
  in the code below) with a small domain {0, ..., range - 1}
  tightly into memory. This works like a bitfield except that the
  fields and sizes don't need to be known at compile time.

  For example, if we have 40 binary variables and 20 variables with
  range 4, storing them would theoretically require at least 80 bits,
  and this class would pack them into 12 bytes (three 4-byte "bins").

  Uses a greedy bin-packing strategy to pack the variables, which
  should be close to optimal in most cases. (See code comments for
  details.)

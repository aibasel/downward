/* A base class for bucket-based shrink strategies.

   A bucket-based strategy partitions the states into an ordered
   vector of buckets, from low to high priority, and then abstracts
   them to a given target size according to the following rules:

   Repeat until we respect the target size:
       If any bucket still contains two states:
           Combine two random states from the non-singleton bucket
           with the lowest priority.
       Otherwise:
           Combine the two lowest-priority buckets.

   For the (usual) case where the target size is larger than the
   number of buckets, this works out in such a way that the
   high-priority buckets are not abstracted at all, the low-priority
   buckets are abstracted by combining all states in each bucket, and
   (up to) one bucket "in the middle" is partially abstracted. */

  Compute target sizes for shrinking two transition systems with sizes size1
  and size2 before they are merged. Use the following rules:
  1) Right before merging, the transition systems may have at most
     max_states_before_merge states.
  2) Right after merging, the product has at most max_states_after_merge states.
  3) Transition systems are shrunk as little as necessary to satisfy the above
     constraints. (If possible, neither is shrunk at all.)
  There is often a Pareto frontier of solutions following these rules. In this
  case, balanced solutions (where the target sizes are close to each other)
  are preferred over less balanced ones.

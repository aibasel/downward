  Factory for factored transition systems.

  Takes a planning task and produces a factored transition system that
  represents the planning task. This provides the main bridge from
  planning tasks to the concepts on which merge-and-shrink abstractions
  are based (transition systems, labels, etc.). The "internal" classes of
  merge-and-shrink should not need to know about planning task concepts.

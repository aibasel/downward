      uses a vector to store PDBs to avoid re-computation of the same PDBs
      later. This is quite a large time gain, but may use too much memory. Also
      a set is used to store all patterns in their "normal form" for duplicate
      detection.

      for each call of add_pattern for the current CanonicalPDBsHeuristic, only
      the pattern is passed as an argument and in CanonicalPDBsHeuristic, the
      PDB is *again* built. One could possibly avoid this by passing the PDB and

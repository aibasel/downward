    /* TODO: Can we do without this "uninitialized" business?

       One reason why it currently exists is to simplify the
       implementation of the EvaluationContext class, where we don't
       want to perform two separate map operations in the case where
       we determine that an entry doesn't yet exist (lookup) and hence
       needs to be created (insertion). This can be avoided most
       easily if we have a default constructor for EvaluationResult
       and if it's easy to test if a given object has just been
       default-constructed.

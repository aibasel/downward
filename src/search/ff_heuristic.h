  TODO: In a better world, this should not derive from
        AdditiveHeuristic. Rather, the common parts should be
        implemented in a common base class. That refactoring could be
        made at the same time at which we also unify this with the
        other relaxation heuristics and the additional FF heuristic
        implementation in the landmark code.

  Overview of classes relevant to storing and working with registered states.

  State
    Objects of this class can represent registered or unregistered states.
    Registered states contain a pointer to the StateRegistry that created them
    and the ID they have there. Using this data, states can be used to index
    PerStateInformation objects.
    In addition, registered states have a pointer to the packed data of a state
    that is stored in their registry. Values of the state can be accessed
    through this pointer. For situations where a state's values have to be
    accessed a lot, the state's data can be unpacked. The unpacked data is
    stored in a vector<int> to which the state maintains a shared pointer.
    Unregistered states contain only this unpacked data. Compared to registered
    states, they are not guaranteed to be reachable and use no form of duplicate
    detection.
    Copying states is relatively cheap because the actual data does not have to
    be copied.

  StateID
    StateIDs identify states within a state registry.
    If the registry is known, the ID is sufficient to look up the state, which
    is why IDs are intended for long term storage (e.g. in open lists).
    Internally, a StateID is just an integer, so it is cheap to store and copy.

  PackedStateBin (currently the same as unsigned int)
    The actual state data is internally represented as a PackedStateBin array.
    Each PackedStateBin can contain the values of multiple variables.
    To minimize allocation overhead, the implementation stores the data of many
    such states in a single large array (see SegmentedArrayVector).
    PackedStateBin arrays are never manipulated directly but through
    the task's state packer (see IntPacker).

  -------------

  StateRegistry
    The StateRegistry allows to create states giving them an ID. IDs from
    different state registries must not be mixed.
    The StateRegistry also stores the actual state data in a memory friendly way.
    It uses the following class:

  SegmentedArrayVector<PackedStateBin>
    This class is used to store the actual (packed) state data for all states
    while avoiding dynamically allocating each state individually.
    The index within this vector corresponds to the ID of the state.

  PerStateInformation<T>
    Associates a value of type T with every state in a given StateRegistry.
    Can be thought of as a very compactly implemented map from State to T.
    References stay valid as long as the state registry exists. Memory usage is
    essentially the same as a vector<T> whose size is the number of states in
    the registry.


  ---------------
  Usage example 1
  ---------------
  Problem:
    A search node contains a state together with some information about how this
    state was reached and the status of the node. The state data is already
    stored and should not be duplicated. Open lists should in theory store search
    nodes but we want to keep the amount of data stored in the open list to a
    minimum.

  Solution:

    SearchNodeInfo
      Remaining part of a search node besides the state that needs to be stored.

    SearchNode
      A SearchNode combines a StateID, a reference to a SearchNodeInfo and
      OperatorCost. It is generated for easier access and not intended for long
      term storage. The state data is only stored once an can be accessed
      through the StateID.

    SearchSpace
      The SearchSpace uses PerStateInformation<SearchNodeInfo> to map StateIDs to
      SearchNodeInfos. The open lists only have to store StateIDs which can be
      used to look up a search node in the SearchSpace on demand.

  ---------------
  Usage example 2
  ---------------
  Problem:
    In the LMcount heuristic each state should store which landmarks are
    already reached when this state is reached. This should only require
    additional memory when the LMcount heuristic is used.

  Solution:
    The heuristic object uses an attribute of type PerStateBitset to store for each
    state and each landmark whether it was reached in this state.

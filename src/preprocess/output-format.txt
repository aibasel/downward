Output of the LAMA Preprocessor
======================================

This file contains no explanation, just an outline of the output file
produced by the LAMA predecessor.  For details on how the predecessor
works, DTGs and causal graphs see Malte Helmert: The Fast Downward
Planning System, JAIR 2006.

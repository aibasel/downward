The invariant checker does not do proper balance checks. In particular, 
it can assume that a delete effect balances an add effect even though 
the delete effect is not guaranteed to cause a change (because its 
triggering is not implied by the precondition/operator condition).

See comment at the beginning of "can_compensate" in invariant_finder.py,
and see e-mail by Ulrich Scholz in Fast Downward folder (2007-07-13,

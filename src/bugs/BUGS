The JAIR experiments uncovered a number of bugs and problems:
- The FF/h1+ heuristic does not support operators without preconditions,
  causing problems for Movie. This is documented in ff_heuristic.cc.
  A fix (only changing ff_heuristic.cc) is in ff-no-preconditions.
  NOTE: This is already fixed now.
- The termination and open queue selection logic in best_first_search.cc 
  is not correct. Moreover, states with infinite CG estimate but finite FF 
  estimate should not be ignored by the multi-heuristic configurations for 
  those to be complete. Moreover, if CG best-first search fails, an FF
  heuristic evaluation should be used as a safety net (this needs to be 
  somehow integrated with dead-end detection). A corrected version is in
  safety-net (I hope -- as of this writing, I am somewhat confused by the
  various versions floating around and am no longer exactly sure which
  does which.)
  NOTE: The termination and queue selection logic is now more reasonable
  as of the Canberra refactoring. The logic is now only off if the CG
  heuristic is used exclusively. Doing a re-run of the planner with the
  FF heuristic in such a case is something that can be done externally;
  no point in messing up the planner code with this logic.
- The "psr-strips-derived-predicates" directory contains an instance
  for which the translator used to generate rubbish. This bug has been
  fixed, but the translator could be improved further for tasks like
  this to simplify the derived variables a bit. See NOTES in the
  directory.

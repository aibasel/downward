The task in this file was reported as unsolvable, although it is
solvable. The reason for this is that it contains axioms which have
conditions that were always true (because they only referred to the
statically true atom "(foo)"), and the translator would omit those,
because it would use the test "if not condition" in place of
"if condition is None". (None is used for signalling an
unsatisfiable condition in this part of the code.)

Fixing this led to a crash during search, however, since search was
not prepared for axioms with empty conditions. For the time being,
this has been fixed by extending search to deal with such axioms, but
in the future it would be better to compile them away, to make search
a bit more efficient. One might also compile away axioms that are
equivalent to other variables, i.e. defined by a single rule X :- Y.
Before doing this, it might make sense to test how common either kind
of axioms are, e.g. in the various PSR formulations.

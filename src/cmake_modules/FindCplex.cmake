# - Find the CPlex LP solver.
# This code defines the following variables:
#
#  CPLEX_FOUND                 - TRUE if Cplex was found.
#  CPLEX_INCLUDE_DIRS          - Full paths to all include dirs.
#  CPLEX_LIBRARIES             - Full paths to all libraries.
#  CPLEX_RUNTIME_LIBRARY       - Full path to the dll file on windows
#
# Usage:
#  find_package(cplex)
#
# The location of Cplex can be specified using the environment variable
# or cmake parameter DOWNWARD_CPLEX_ROOT.
#
# Note that the standard FIND_PACKAGE features are supported
# (i.e., QUIET, REQUIRED, etc.).

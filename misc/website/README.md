The script `build_website.py` builds the website locally, combining the following components:
 - `docs/` directory of the Fast Downward repository (= this repository)
 - documentation of the search plugins generated by `misc/autodoc/generate-docs.py`
 - documentation from a clone of https://github.com/aibasel/downward-markdown

The content is generated from the current local working copies of the repositories.
In contrast to the public website, the generated website only contains the
pages for this version (not for previous releases).

## Setup

Create a python virtual environment and activate it:
```
$ python -m venv .env
$ source .env/bin/activate
```

Install the requirements:
```
$ python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Set the environment variable `DOWNWARD_MARKDOWN` to a local copy of the
downward-markdown repository (https://github.com/aibasel/downward-markdown):
```
$ export DOWNWARD_MARKDOWN=<path to local working copy>
```

## Usage

Build the website with the following command:
```
$ ./build_website.py
```

It creates a directory `build`. To see the website, enter this directory and
run mkdocs (you can of course use a different port):
```
$ cd build
$ mkdocs serve -a localhost:8001
```

Open `http://localhost:8001/` in your favorite browser.

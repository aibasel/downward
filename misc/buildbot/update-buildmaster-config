## NOTE on using this script:
##
## - This script must be run manually on the buildmaster.
##   There is no automated trigger to restart the buildbot when the
##   config in the repository changes.
##
##   To run this script (assuming you have everything set up
##   properly), do:
##
##   $ ssh aidev
##   $ ./update-buildmaster-config
##
## NOTE on modifying this script:
##
## - The master version of this script lives in the Fast Downward
##   repository under misc/buildbot. If you modify the version on
##   the aidev server, make sure to feed the changes back to the
##   repository.

## This script restarts the buildmaster. Note that this disconnects
## the buildslaves as a side effect. I think they should automatically
## try to reconnect after a while, but I am not sure. The aidev
## buildslave is restarted automatically by this script, so it should
## be back up immediately.
##
## Run this script on cs-aidev whenever the buildmaster config has
## changed. This fetches the newest buildmaster config from the
## default branch of hg.fast-downward.org and installs it.
##
## This needs to be run by someone with sudo privileges.

## command, and we must set -l so that we have a bash login shell.
